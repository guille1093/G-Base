# G-Base
G-base is a powerful and user-friendly database management tool that allows you to easily store, organize, and retrieve your data.

## What's new in this fork?
This is a fork of Pocketbase and includes several enhancements to the original version:
* Spanish IU support.
* A beloved dark mode with a dark purple color palette.

* Model validations: We have added model validation checks to ensure that your data is always accurate and consistent.

* Custom middlewares: We have also added custom middlewares to better adapt Pocketbase to your specific needs. These middlewares allow you to customize the way Pocketbase handles your data and makes it easier to integrate with other systems.

## How to use G-Base
Using G-base is easy! Simply install the tool on your computer and start adding your data. You can organize your information using tables and columns, and use powerful search and filtering features to find what you need. G-base also includes a variety of customization options, so you can tailor the interface and functionality to your liking.

## Note 
This fork of Pocketbase is being used for a personal project and may not be relevant for all users. If you are not looking to make specific changes or additions to Pocketbase, it is recommended to use the original version. It started as a way to learn Go and avoid possible breaking changes in the original version, but I decided to share it in case it is useful to someone else.

## Thanks
Thanks to the Pocketbase team for creating such a great tool! We hope you enjoy using G-Base as much as I do.
